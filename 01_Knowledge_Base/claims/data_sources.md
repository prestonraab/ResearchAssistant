## C_31: The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is an international public repository archiving gene expression and epigenomics data

**Category**: Data Source  
**Source**: Clough2023 (Source ID: 17)
**Context**: Handles over 200,000 studies and 6.5 million samples, all indexed, searchable, and downloadable.

**Primary Quote**:
> "The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is an international public repository that archives gene expression and epigenomics data sets generated b y ne xt-generation sequencing and microarra y technologies. Data are typically submitted to GEO by researchers in compliance with widespread journal and funder mandates to make generated data publicly accessible. The resource handles raw data files, processed data files and descriptive met adat a f or o v er 20 0 0 0 0 studies and 6.5 million samples, all of which are inde x ed, searchable and do wnloadable."

## C_68: The Anderson et al. [2014] study investigated childhood tuberculosis diagnosis in South Africa, Malawi, and Kenya

**Category**: Data Source  
**Source**: Anderson2014 (Source ID: 45)
**Context**: Used a 51-transcript signature to distinguish tuberculosis from other diseases in children. Data available as GEO Series accession number GSE39941.

**Primary Quote**:
> "The study population comprised prospective cohorts of children who were undergoing evaluation for suspected tuberculosis in South Africa (655 children), Malawi (701 children), and Kenya (1599 children). Patients were assigned to groups according to whether the diagnosis was culture-confirmed tuberculosis, culture-negative tuberculosis, diseases other than tuberculosis, or latent tuberculosis infection. Diagnostic signatures distinguishing tuberculosis from other diseases and from latent tuberculosis infection were identified from genomewide analysis of RNA expression in host blood."

## C_69: The Zak et al. [2016] study identified a 16-gene blood RNA signature to predict progression to active tuberculosis disease

**Category**: Data Source  
**Source**: Zak2016 (Source ID: 23)
**Context**: Used as training dataset A in the analysis of domain adaptation in small-scale and heterogeneous biological datasets.

**Primary Quote**:
> "A 16 gene signature of risk was identified. The signature predicted tuberculosis progression with a sensitivity of 66·1% (95% CI 63·2-68·9) and a specificity of 80·6% (79·2-82·0) in the 12 months preceding tuberculosis diagnosis."

## C_70: The Suliman et al. [2018] study investigated tuberculosis progression in household contacts from South Africa, The Gambia, and Ethiopia

**Category**: Data Source  
**Source**: Suliman2018 (Source ID: 24)
**Context**: Developed the RISK4 four-gene signature to predict TB progression in recently exposed household contacts from diverse African populations.

**Primary Quote**:
> "A four-transcript signature derived from samples in a South African and Gambian training set predicted progression up to two years before onset of disease in blinded test set samples from South Africa, the Gambia, and Ethiopia with little population-associated variability, and it was also validated in an external cohort of South African adolescents with latent M. tuberculosis infection."

## C_71: The Leong et al. [2018] study investigated active vs latent tuberculosis in South Indian populations

**Category**: Data Source  
**Source**: Leong2018 (Source ID: 25)
**Context**: N/A

**Primary Quote**:
> "Several studies have identified blood transcriptomic signatures that can distinguish active from latent Tuberculosis (TB). The purpose of this study was to assess how well these existing gene profiles classify TB disease in a South Indian population."

## C_72: The Walter et al. [2016] study compared M. tuberculosis and host gene expression between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients with active tuberculosis in Gambia and Uganda

**Category**: Data Source  
**Source**: Walter2016 (Source ID: 26)
**Context**: This study examines a different classification task (HIV+ vs HIV- in active TB patients) compared to most other studies in this collection which focus on active vs latent TB or TB progression. Study compared M. tuberculosis and human gene transcription in sputum samples.

**Primary Quote**:
> "It is unknown whether immunosuppression influences the physiologic state of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vivo. We evaluated the impact of host immunity by comparing M. tuberculosis and human gene transcription in sputum between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and uninfected patients with tuberculosis."

## C_73: The Kaforou et al. [2013] study (GSE37250_SA) investigated active vs latent tuberculosis in South African populations

**Category**: Data Source  
**Source**: Kaforou2013 (Source ID: 27)
**Context**: Book_chapter.md lists year as 2013, add_paper.py metadata lists year as 2023.

**Primary Quote**:
> "We hypothesized that a unique host blood RNA transcriptional signature would distinguish TB from other diseases (OD) in HIV-infected and -uninfected patients, and that this could be the basis of a simple diagnostic test."

## C_74: The Kaforou et al. [2013] study (GSE37250_M) investigated active vs latent tuberculosis in Malawian populations

**Category**: Data Source  
**Source**: Kaforou2013 (Source ID: 27)
**Context**: Book_chapter.md lists year as 2013, add_paper.py metadata lists year as 2023.

**Primary Quote**:
> "Karonga district, Northern Malawi. The incidence of new TB cases in Karonga district (180 per 100,000, Karonga Prevention Study unpublished data, 2012) and the stable HIV prevalence (10%-15% of females aged 25-29, Karonga Prevention Study unpublished data, 2012) are lower in Karonga than in Cape Town. Malaria and helminth infection are hyperendemic. Patients were recruited at Karonga District hospital, which serves a rural population living by the shores of Lake Malawi."
