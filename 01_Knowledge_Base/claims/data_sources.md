## C_69: The Zak et al. [2016] study identified a 16-gene blood RNA signature to predict progression to active tuberculosis disease

**Category**: Data Source  
**Source**: Zak2016 (Source ID: 23)  
**Context**: Used as training dataset A in the analysis of domain adaptation in small-scale and heterogeneous biological datasets.

**Primary Quote** (Summary):
> "A 16 gene signature of risk was identified. The signature predicted tuberculosis progression with a sensitivity of 66·1% (95% CI 63·2-68·9) and a specificity of 80·6% (79·2-82·0) in the 12 months preceding tuberculosis diagnosis."

**Supporting Quotes**:
- (Introduction): "Knowledge gained from this signature could lead to targeted antimicrobial therapy to prevent tuberculosis disease, as treating all people who are latently infected in endemic countries for 6-9 months is not feasible."

## C_70: The Suliman et al. [2018] study investigated tuberculosis progression in household contacts from South Africa, The Gambia, and Ethiopia

**Category**: Data Source  
**Source**: Suliman2018 (Source ID: 24)  
**Context**: Developed the RISK4 four-gene signature to predict TB progression in recently exposed household contacts from diverse African populations.

**Primary Quote** (Abstract):
> "A four-transcript signature derived from samples in a South African and Gambian training set predicted progression up to two years before onset of disease in blinded test set samples from South Africa, the Gambia, and Ethiopia with little population-associated variability, and it was also validated in an external cohort of South African adolescents with latent M. tuberculosis infection."

**Supporting Quotes**:
- (Methods): "The HHC study included participants from four African sites (South Africa, the Gambia, Ethiopia, and Uganda) as part of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges 6-74 (GC6-74) program."
- (Results): "We enrolled 4,466 HIV-negative healthy HHCs of 1,098 index TB cases between 2006 and 2010 into the GC6-74 cohorts across four African sites."
- (Results): "The RISK4 signature comprising four unique genes: GAS6 (growth arrest–specific 6) and SEPT4 (septin 4), which were upregulated, and CD1C (cluster of differentiation 1C) and BLK (B lymphocyte kinase), which were downregulated, in progressors versus matched control subjects."
- (Conclusions): "Collectively, we developed a simple whole blood–based PCR test to predict TB in recently exposed household contacts from diverse African populations. This test has potential for implementation in national TB contact investigation programs."

## C_72: The Walter et al. [2016] study compared M. tuberculosis and host gene expression between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients with active tuberculosis in Gambia and Uganda

**Category**: Data Source  
**Source**: Walter2016 (Source ID: 26)  
**Context**: This study examines a different classification task (HIV+ vs HIV- in active TB patients) compared to most other studies in this collection which focus on active vs latent TB or TB progression. Study compared M. tuberculosis and human gene transcription in sputum samples.

**Primary Quote** (Abstract):
> "We compared M. tuberculosis and human gene transcription in sputum between HIV-infected and uninfected patients with tuberculosis."

**Supporting Quotes**:
- (Title): "Adaptation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to Impaired Host Immunity in HIV-Infected Patients"
- (Abstract): "We collected sputum specimens before treatment from Gambians and Ugandans with pulmonary tuberculosis, revealed by positive results of acid-fast bacillus smears."
- (Abstract): "A total of 24 of 65 patients with tuberculosis were HIV infected. M. tuberculosis DosR regulon genes were less highly expressed among HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis than among HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis (Gambia, P < .0001; Uganda, P = .037)."
- (Results): "In profiling of human genes from the same sputa, HIV-infected patients had 3.4-fold lower expression of IFNG (P = .005), 4.9-fold higher expression of ARG1 (P = .0006), and 3.4-fold higher expression of IL10 (P = .0002) than in HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculosis."

## C_73: The Kaforou et al. [2013] study (GSE37250_SA) investigated active vs latent tuberculosis in South African populations

**Category**: Data Source  
**Source**: Kaforou2013 (Source ID: 27)  
**Context**: Book_chapter.md lists year as 2013, add_paper.py metadata lists year as 2023.

**Primary Quote** (Abstract):
> "We hypothesized that a unique host blood RNA transcriptional signature would distinguish TB from other diseases (OD) in HIV-infected and -uninfected patients, and that this could be the basis of a simple diagnostic test."

**Supporting Quotes**:
- (Title): "Detection of Tuberculosis in HIV-Infected and -Uninfected African Adults Using Whole Blood RNA Expression Signatures: A Case-Control Study"
- (Methods): "Cape Town, South Africa. South Africa has one of the highest TB incidence rates in Africa (981 per 100,000), as well as high rates of HIV infection (up to 41.8% prevalence in females aged 25-35)."

## C_74: The Kaforou et al. [2013] study (GSE37250_M) investigated active vs latent tuberculosis in Malawian populations

**Category**: Data Source  
**Source**: Kaforou2013 (Source ID: 27)  
**Context**: Book_chapter.md lists year as 2013, add_paper.py metadata lists year as 2023.

**Primary Quote** (Methods):
> "Karonga district, Northern Malawi. The incidence of new TB cases in Karonga district (180 per 100,000, Karonga Prevention Study unpublished data, 2012) and the stable HIV prevalence (10%-15% of females aged 25-29, Karonga Prevention Study unpublished data, 2012) are lower in Karonga than in Cape Town. Malaria and helminth infection are hyperendemic. Patients were recruited at Karonga District hospital, which serves a rural population living by the shores of Lake Malawi."

**Supporting Quotes**:
- (Abstract): "We hypothesized that a unique host blood RNA transcriptional signature would distinguish TB from other diseases (OD) in HIV-infected and -uninfected patients, and that this could be the basis of a simple diagnostic test."
- (Methods): "In order to enable generalization of our findings to African countries with differing prevalence of malaria and other parasitic infections, as well as other environmental exposures that might affect transcriptional profiles, we chose highly contrasting study sites (one urban, one rural) in two African countries with differing co-endemic diseases"

## C_68: The Anderson et al. [2014] study investigated childhood tuberculosis diagnosis in South Africa, Malawi, and Kenya

**Category**: Data Source  
**Source**: Anderson2014 (Source ID: 45)  
**Context**: Used a 51-transcript signature to distinguish tuberculosis from other diseases in children. Data available as GEO Series accession number GSE39941.

**Primary Quote** (Abstract):
> "The study population comprised prospective cohorts of children who were undergoing evaluation for suspected tuberculosis in South Africa (655 children), Malawi (701 children), and Kenya (1599 children). Patients were assigned to groups according to whether the diagnosis was culture-confirmed tuberculosis, culture-negative tuberculosis, diseases other than tuberculosis, or latent tuberculosis infection. Diagnostic signatures distinguishing tuberculosis from other diseases and from latent tuberculosis infection were identified from genomewide analysis of RNA expression in host blood."

**Supporting Quotes**:
- (Results): "We identified a 51-transcript signature distinguishing tuberculosis from other diseases in the South African and Malawian children (the discovery cohort). In the Kenyan children (the validation cohort), a risk score based on the signature for tuberculosis and for diseases other than tuberculosis showed a sensitivity of 82.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 68.6"
- (Methods): "We recruited children from three African countries with a high burden of tuberculosis. To identify RNA-transcript signatures associated with active tuberculosis, we used a discovery cohort comprising children evaluated for suspected tuberculosis in hospitals in South Africa and Malawi. We then assessed the performance of these signatures in an independent validation cohort of children evaluated for suspected tuberculosis in hospitals in Kenya."
