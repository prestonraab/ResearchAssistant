## C_1769770128272: By aggregating data from independent cohorts, researchers can move beyond the limitations of small sample sizes to build more robust machine learning classifiers. Combining datasets becomes useful when individual studies have limited sample sizes, when validation across independent cohorts is needed, or when meta-analyses can reveal consistent patterns across diverse populations.  Larger sample sizes increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena, enable more robust classifier training, and improve generalizability of findings.

## C_1770403547313: Oncotype DX has been approved and implemented clinically to predict personalized recurrence risk in ER+ breast cancer and guide chemotherapy decisions

**Category**: Uncategorized  
**Source**: Buus2021  
**Context**: Multi-gene prognostic signatures that have been approved and implemented clinically include Oncotype DX, EndoPredict, and Prosigna, which are used to predict personalized recurrence risk in ER+ breast cancer and guide chemotherapy decisions. [source:: C_05]

> "1234567890():,; <!-- image --> ## ARTICLE OPEN <!-- image --> ## Development and validation for research assessment of Oncotype DX ® Breast Recurrence Score, EndoPredict ® and Prosigna ® Richard Buus 1,2 , Zsolt Szijgyarto 3 , Eugene F.

Cheang 3 ✉ Multi-gene prognostic signatures including the Oncotype ® DX Recurrence Score (RS), EndoPredict ® (EP) and Prosigna ® (Risk Of Recurrence, ROR) are widely used to predict the likelihood of distant recurrence in patients with oestrogen-receptor-positive (ER + ), HER2-negative breast cancer. Here, we describe the development and validation of methods to recapitulate RS, EP and ROR scores from NanoString expression data."

**Supporting Quotes**:
- "However, a substantial risk remains for relapse. Multi-parameter gene-expression-based prognostic signatures are often used to estimate the residual risk of recurrence after surgery to guide patient management. Amongst the most widely used prognostic signatures in ER + breast cancer are the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) 4 , EndoPredict (EP/EPclin) 5 and Prosigna ® Risk Of Recurrence score (ROR) 6 . Each of these have been endorsed for prognostic use in authoritative guidelines 7,8 . RS consists of 16 prognostic genes and /uniFB01 ve reference genes assessed by RT-PCR. Thirteen of the prognostic genes are grouped into four modules (proliferation, oestrogen, HER2 and invasion), which allow these features to be weighted differently in the signature algorithm with scale between 0 and 100 4 . The HER2 and proliferation modules are thresholded such that quantitative readouts from those modules are only differentiated in tumours with high expression for the respective modules."
