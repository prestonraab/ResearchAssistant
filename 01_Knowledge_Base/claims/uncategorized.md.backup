**Primary Quote**:
> "A classifier consists of a collection of predictor variables and a classification rule such that, given observed values of the predictor variables for a sample, we can plug them into the classification rule and based on the result assign a group label to the sample. To build such a classifier in a supervised setting, we need a training data set , consisting of samples for which we are given the observed values of a number of variables as well as the true group labels."
