## C_27: Challenges in microarray meta-analysis include overcoming different study aims, designs, and populations

**Category**: Challenge  
**Source**: Campain2010 (Source ID: 16)  
**Context**: Differing platforms and probe mapping make comparisons difficult; laboratory effects like experimental procedures and sample preparation also contribute.

**Primary Quote** (Background):
> "There are a number of issues associated with applying meta-analysis in gene expression studies. These include problems common to traditional meta-analysis such as overcoming different aims, design and populations of interest. There are also concerns specific to gene expression data including challenges with probes and probe sets, differing platforms being compared and laboratory effects."

## C_46: Most state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods face challenges when applied to biological datasets

**Category**: Challenge  
**Source**: Orouji2024 (Source ID: 20)  
**Context**: Biological datasets are expensive to collect and have complex feature spaces.

**Primary Quote** (Abstract):
> "However, most state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods were designed for largescale data such as images, whereas biological datasets are smaller and have more features, and these are also complex and heterogeneous."

## C_47: Specific challenges for applying domain adaptation to biological data include poor sample-to-feature ratios and complex feature spaces

**Category**: Challenge  
**Source**: Orouji2024 (Source ID: 20)  
**Context**: These factors can substantially hinder data aggregation and model performance.

**Primary Quote** (Table 2):
> "State-of-the-art DA approaches often require tens of thousands (or even millions) of samples to train [e.g. ( 27 - 29 )], but biological datasets have a few dozens or hundreds of samples despite having thousands of features ( 31 - 33 ). DA models should be evaluated on biological-scale datasets [e.g., Office31 ( 36 )]."

## C_96: Mass spectrometry-based proteomics data are inherently biased due to sample handling and instrumentation differences

**Category**: Challenge  
**Source**: Valikangas2016 (Source ID: 35)  

**Primary Quote** (Abstract):
> "To date, mass spectrometry (MS) data remain inherently biased as a result of reasons ranging from sample handling to differences caused by the instrumentation. Normalization is the process that aims to account for the bias and make samples more comparable."
