## C_35: GEO data are widely reused for identifying novel gene expression patterns, finding disease predictors, and developing computational methods

**Category**: Application  
**Context**: Over 31,000 third-party papers use GEO data to support or complement independent studies.

**Primary Quote**:
> "GEO is a widely used international public repository for high-throughput gene expression and epigenomic data and continues to grow at an increasing rate. The database has become an essential resource for researchers across a wide range of disciplines, including genomics, molecular biology, biomedicine and bioinformatics."

## C_108: Batch effects can lead to lack of reproducibility and lower-than-expected classification rates in clinical predictors, potentially putting patients at risk

**Category**: Application  
**Context**: Undetected batch effects in predictors developed for clinical outcomes can produce more variable results than expected and adversely affect classification performance.

**Primary Quote**:
> "If batch effects go undetected, they can lead to substantial misallocation of resources and lack of reproducibility. In general, technology that has been developed for the prediction of clinical outcomes using data that show batch effects may produce results that are more variable than expected. Batch effects were shown to have strong adverse effects on predictors built with methods that are naive to these effects; the result is lower-than-expected classification rates, which might put patients classified with these technologies at risk."

## C_109: Single-patient data processing is vital to the translation of molecular assays, as clinical settings typically collect patient samples in small numbers

**Category**: Application  
**Context**: Multi-sample batch correction methods are impractical in clinical settings where samples are processed individually or in small numbers.

**Primary Quote**:
> "Multisample methods are impractical in clinical settings, where patient samples are typically collected in small numbers, often one at a time, making single-patient data processing vital to the translation of molecular assays."
