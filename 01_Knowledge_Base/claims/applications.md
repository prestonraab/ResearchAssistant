## C_35: GEO data are widely reused for identifying novel gene expression patterns, finding disease predictors, and developing computational methods

**Category**: Application  
**Source**: Clough2023  
**Context**: Over 31,000 third-party papers use GEO data to support or complement independent studies.

**Primary Quote**:
> "The community re-uses GEO data in diverse ways, including finding evidence of novel gene expression patterns, identifying disease predictors, and generally aggregating and analyzing data in ways not anticipated by the original data generators."

## C_107: Multi-gene prognostic signatures are widely used clinically to guide treatment decisions in breast cancer

**Category**: Application  
**Source**: Buus2021  
**Context**: These signatures estimate residual risk of recurrence after surgery to guide patient management.

**Primary Quote**:
> "Multi-parameter gene-expression-based prognostic signatures are often used to estimate the residual risk of recurrence after surgery to guide patient management. Amongst the most widely used prognostic signatures in ER+ breast cancer are the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS), EndoPredict (EP/EPclin) and Prosigna® Risk Of Recurrence score (ROR). Each of these have been endorsed for prognostic use in authoritative guidelines."

## C_108: Batch effects can lead to lack of reproducibility and lower-than-expected classification rates in clinical predictors, potentially putting patients at risk

**Category**: Application  
**Context**: Undetected batch effects in predictors developed for clinical outcomes can produce more variable results than expected and adversely affect classification performance.

**Primary Quote**:
> "If batch effects go undetected, they can lead to substantial misallocation of resources and lack of reproducibility. In general, technology that has been developed for the prediction of clinical outcomes using data that show batch effects may produce results that are more variable than expected. Batch effects were shown to have strong adverse effects on predictors built with methods that are naive to these effects; the result is lower-than-expected classification rates, which might put patients classified with these technologies at risk."

## C_109: Single-patient data processing is vital to the translation of molecular assays, as clinical settings typically collect patient samples in small numbers

**Category**: Application  
**Context**: Multi-sample batch correction methods are impractical in clinical settings where samples are processed individually or in small numbers.

**Primary Quote**:
> "Multisample methods are impractical in clinical settings, where patient samples are typically collected in small numbers, often one at a time, making single-patient data processing vital to the translation of molecular assays."
