## C_33: Over the last decade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data has grown to make up the bulk (85%) of GEO submissions

**Category**: Data Trend  
**Source**: Clough2023 (Source ID: 17)  
**Context**: GEO consisted almost entirely of microarray data for the first 10 years of its existence.

**Primary Quote**:
> "While GEO consisted almost entirely of microarray data for the first 10 years of its existence, unsurprisingly, the proportion of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data has grown and now makes up the bulk (85%) of submissions."

## C_34: Single-cell RNA-seq studies have significantly increased in GEO, comprising 21% of all RNA-seq studies released in 2022

**Category**: Data Trend  
**Source**: Clough2023 (Source ID: 17)  
**Context**: Reflects the growing focus on single-cell transcriptomes.

**Primary Quote**:
> "Since 2017, the number of single-cell RNA-seq studies increased each year such that in 2022, 21% of RNA-seq studies released by GEO were performed on single cells"

**Supporting Quotes**:
- "Between 2009 and 2015 GEO released fewer than 100 single-cell RNA-seq studies per year."
