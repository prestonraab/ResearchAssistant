**Category**: Method  
**Source**: Alharbi2023  
**Context**: Batch effects confound performance estimates.

**Primary Quote**:
> "LIGER takes as input multiple single-cell datasets, which may be scRNA-seq experiments from different individuals, time points, or species-or measurements from different molecular modalities, such as single-cell epigenome data or spatial gene expression data (Figure 1A). LIGER then employs integrative non-negative matrix factorization (iNMF) (Yang and Michailidis, 2016) to learn a low-dimensional space in which each cell is defined by one set of dataset-specific factors, or metagenes, and another set of shared metagenes (Figure 1B)."

## C_29: Meta-analysis methods can be categorized into 'relative' and 'absolute' approaches

**Category**: Method  
**Source**: Campain2010  
**Context**: 'Relative' methods include Fisher's inverse chi-square, GeneMeta, and RankProd; 'absolute' methods are exemplified by the 'simple' meta method.

**Primary Quote**:
> "It is possible to consider meta-analysis at two levels, 'relative' and 'absolute' meta-analysis. 'Relative' metaanalysis looks at how genes or features correlate to a phenotype within a dataset. Multiple datasets are either aggregated or compared to obtain features which are commonly considered important. Meta-methods pertaining to this method include Fisher's inverse chisquare, GeneMeta, RankProd and the 'dataset cross-validation' meta. 'Absolute' meta-analysis seeks to combine the raw or transformed data from multiple experiments. By increasing the number of samples used, the statistical power of a test is increased. Traditional microarray analysis tools are then used on these larger datasets. The 'simple' meta method is an example of 'absolute' metaanalysis approach."

**Category**: Method  
**Source**: Alharbi2023  
**Context**: Tests the null hypothesis of no differences in expression means between groups for a given gene.

**Primary Quote**:

**Category**: Method  
**Source**: Alharbi2023  
**Context**: Emphasizes the need for DA research to focus on data-scarce regimes.

**Primary Quote**:
> "This domain-invariant mapping should be done using methods that work with limited data in individual cohorts. Although deep learning models are great tools to uncover highly nonlinear and complex relations in data with no specific assumptions, they often require many samples... We recommend that DA research focuses on performance under data-scarce regimes, including explicit truncation of training datasets to evaluate DA methods under highly undesirable sample-to-feature ratios."

**Source**: Díaz-Uriarte and Alvarez de Andrés 2006  
**Context**: Variable importance measures have been suggested as screening tools for gene expression studies.

**Primary Quote**:
> "random forest is a classification algorithm well suited for microarray data: it shows excellent performance even when most predictive variables are noise, can be used when the number of variables is much larger than the number of observations and in problems involving more than two classes, and returns measures of variable importance."

**Category**: Method  
**Source**: Zou2005  
**Context**: L1 penalty enables sparse solutions suitable for high-dimensional gene expression data.

**Category**: Method  
**Source**: Du2010  
**Context**: This necessitates transformation to M-values before applying standard batch correction.

**Primary Quote**:
> "The Beta-value range is from 0 and 1 and can be interpreted as an approximation of the percentage of methlyation. However, because the Beta-value has a bounded range, this statistic violates the Gaussian distribution assumption used by many statistical methods, including the very prevalent t-test."


---


## C_94: M-values (log2 ratio of methylated to unmethylated intensities) have better statistical properties for differential methylation analysis

**Category**: Method  
**Source**: Du2010  
**Context**: M-values are more statistically valid than Beta-values for parametric tests.

**Primary Quote**:
> "the M-value is more statistically valid for the differential analysis of methylation levels"


---


## C_95: For DNA methylation analysis, M-values should be used for statistical testing while beta-values should be reported for biological interpretation

**Category**: Method  
**Source**: Du2010  
**Context**: This recommendation balances statistical validity with interpretability in methylation studies.

**Primary Quote**:
> "The Beta-value has a more intuitive biological interpretation, but the M-value is more statistically valid for the differential analysis of methylation levels.
