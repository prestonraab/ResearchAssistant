| C_25 | Result | For gene expression data, Wasserstein distance and correlation metrics consistently outperform mutual information-based metrics in classification accuracy and F1-score, particularly in multi-cluster structures. | 15 | Wasserstein metric showed better balance between classification quality and cluster uniformity in multi-cluster structures. |
| C_26 | Method | Meta-analysis in gene expression studies combines results from independent but related datasets to increase statistical power and identify consistent patterns. | 16 | Aids in finding effects that exist and important subtle variations. |
| C_27 | Challenge | Challenges in microarray meta-analysis include overcoming different study aims, designs, and populations, as well as issues specific to gene expression data such as differing platforms and laboratory effects. | 16 | Differing platforms and probe mapping make comparisons difficult; laboratory effects like experimental procedures and sample preparation also contribute. |
| C_28 | Method | The meta differential expression via distance synthesis (mDEDS) method is a meta-analysis approach that extends the DEDS method to identify differentially expressed genes by integrating multiple statistical measures across datasets. | 16 | Designed to be resilient to varying complexity levels in meta-analysis and robust against measure-specific and platform-specific bias. |
| C_29 | Method | Meta-analysis methods can be categorized into 'relative' (correlating genes to a phenotype within datasets) and 'absolute' (combining raw or transformed data to increase statistical power) approaches. | 16 | 'Relative' methods include Fisher's inverse chi-square, GeneMeta, and RankProd; 'absolute' methods are exemplified by the 'simple' meta method. |
| C_30 | Method | Fisher's inverse chi-square method combines p-values from independent datasets, and its effectiveness can be extended by weighting datasets based on quality. | 16 | Tests the null hypothesis of no differences in expression means between groups for a given gene. |
| C_31 | Data Source | The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is an international public repository archiving gene expression and epigenomics data from next-generation sequencing and microarray technologies. | 17 | Handles over 200,000 studies and 6.5 million samples, all indexed, searchable, and downloadable. |
| C_32 | Method | GEO generates consistently computed gene expression count matrices for thousands of RNA-seq studies and offers web-based tools (GEO2R) that facilitate analysis and visualization of differential gene expression. | 17 | New interactive graphical plots help users identify differentially expressed genes and assess data set quality. |
| C_33 | Data Trend | Over the last decade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, particularly RNA-seq, has grown to make up the bulk (85%) of GEO submissions. | 17 | RNA-seq studies have represented over half of all studies submitted each year since 2018. |
| C_34 | Data Trend | Single-cell RNA-seq studies have significantly increased in GEO, comprising 21% of all RNA-seq studies released in 2022. | 17 | Reflects the growing focus on single-cell transcriptomes. |
| C_35 | Application | GEO data are widely reused for identifying novel gene expression patterns, finding disease predictors, integrating disparate datasets, elucidating molecular networks, drug repurposing, and developing/validating computational and machine learning methods. | 17 | Over 31,000 third-party papers use GEO data to support or complement independent studies. |
| C_36 | Impact | Unmeasured or unmodeled factors can introduce widespread and detrimental effects on gene expression studies, including reduced power, induced unwanted dependence, and spurious signals. | 18 | This phenomenon is true even for well-designed, randomized studies. |
| C_37 | Method | Surrogate Variable Analysis (SVA) is a method to identify, estimate, and utilize components of expression heterogeneity (EH) to overcome problems caused by unmeasured or unmodeled factors. | 18 | Can be applied in conjunction with standard analysis techniques to accurately capture the relationship between expression and any modeled variables of interest. |
| C_38 | Result | SVA increases the biological accuracy and reproducibility of analyses in genome-wide expression studies. | 18 | Achieves operating characteristics nearly equivalent to what one would obtain with no expression heterogeneity at all. |
| C_39 | Impact | Expression heterogeneity can lead to extra variability in expression levels, spurious signals due to confounding, and long-range dependence in noise. | 18 | Occurs even if measured factors like age act on distinct sets of genes or interact with unobserved factors. |
| C_40 | Method | SVA improves the accuracy and stability of gene ranking for differential expression, leading to more powerful and reproducible results. | 18 | Achieved by adjusting for surrogate variables that capture unmodeled factors, reducing spurious differential expression. |
| C_41 | Method | GMMchi is a Python package leveraging Gaussian Mixture Modeling to detect and characterize bimodal gene expression patterns across cancer samples, using 2x2 contingency table statistics. | 19 | Designed to analyze correlations between dichotomous gene expression shifts and driver mutations. |
| C_42 | Result | GMMchi robustly and reliably extracts bimodal patterns from both colorectal cancer (CRC) cell line-derived microarray and tumor-derived RNA-Seq data. | 19 | Confirmed previously reported gene expression correlates of well-characterized CRC phenotypes. |
| C_43 | Result | GMMchi achieved 85% accuracy with a sample size of n=90 in simulated data, and exceeds 90% accuracy with a sample size of about 1000. | 19 | Demonstrates accuracy in categorizing simulated distributions. |
| C_44 | Challenge | The "tail problem" in Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) refers to non-normally distributed tails of outliers in gene expression data that are inadequately dealt with by traditional GMM. | 19 | GMMchi addresses this by iteratively removing data points from the extreme end of the tail while fitting the remaining points with GMM and using Chi-square fitting. |
| C_45 | Method | Domain adaptation (DA), a subfield of transfer learning, addresses the problem of models not generalizing across datasets from different cohorts or laboratories by aligning the statistical distributions of source and target domains. | 20 | Alleviates issues caused by technical and biological differences between datasets. |
| C_46 | Challenge | Most state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods, designed for large-scale data like images, face challenges when applied to biological datasets due to smaller sample sizes, high dimensionality (more features than samples), and inherent complexity and heterogeneity. | 20 | Biological datasets are expensive to collect and have complex feature spaces. |
| C_47 | Challenge | Specific challenges for applying domain adaptation to biological data include poor sample-to-feature ratios, complex feature spaces with missing values or different dimensionalities, heterogeneous features with unknown mappings, and skewed feature importance distributions. | 20 | These factors can substantially hinder data aggregation and model performance. |
| C_48 | Method | Effective domain adaptation for biological datasets requires methods that work with limited data in individual cohorts, such as simpler neural network architectures, and explicit evaluation under highly undesirable sample-to-feature ratios. | 20 | Emphasizes the need for DA research to focus on data-scarce regimes. |
| C_49 | Impact | Failure of adaptability between source and target domains in domain adaptation can lead to negative transfer, where applying knowledge from a source domain negatively affects the performance of a model in a target domain. | 20 | Highlights a critical theoretical limitation of DA. |
| C_50 | Method | CycleMix is a novel scalable cell-cycle classification algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Modeling, designed to assign single cells into multiple cycling states (e.g., G1, S, G2M) and identify non-cycling cells. | 21 | Addresses heterogeneity of the cell cycle in single-cell RNAseq and spatial transcriptomics. |
| C_51 | Result | CycleMix can flexibly assign cells to any number of states and accurately distinguish cycling from non-cycling cells, outperforming Seurat which often incorrectly labels non-cycling cells as S/G2M. | 21 | Benchmarked on low-throughput scRNAseq datasets and found to be the best performing method on high-throughput datasets. |
| C_52 | Method | CycleMix uses a weighted average of log-normalized expression from positive and negative marker genes to generate phase-specific scores, which are then binarized by fitting a mixture of Gaussian distributions, with the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) selecting the optimal model. | 21 | Marker gene lists from multiple sources are available within CycleMix, including those used by Seurat and Tirosh et al. (2016). |
| C_53 | Result | Benchmarking on high-throughput droplet-based scRNAseq datasets showed CycleMix accurately assigned over 90% of quiescent cells to a non-cycling phase, whereas Seurat assigned 25%-50% of quiescent cells to S/G2M. | 21 | This was consistent with Seurat exhibiting much higher false-positive rates for S and G2M cell-type assignments. |
| C_54 | Method | CycleMix can regress out cell-cycle phase differences using discrete classifications, preserving differences between cycling and non-cycling cells, proving more effective than Seurat's score-based full regression. | 21 | This partial regression model helps to distinguish problematic cell-cycle variability from biologically relevant cell-type variability. |
| C_55 | Method | PhenoGMM is an automated model-based fingerprinting approach based on Gaussian mixture models that quantifies changes in microbial community structure using flow cytometry data. | 22 | It processes large amounts of quantitative single-cell data generated by cytometry. |
| C_56 | Result | PhenoGMM successfully quantifies changes in microbial community structure based on flow cytometry data, expressed in terms of cytometric diversity, supporting rapid and quantitative screening of microbial community structure and dynamics. | 22 | Evaluated using data sets from both synthetic and natural ecosystems. |
| C_57 | Challenge | Microbial cytometry data present different characteristics compared to immunophenotyping data, including smaller cell size, lack of general antibody-based panels, and highly overlapping cytometric distributions, complicating automated cell population identification. | 22 | This necessitates specialized data analysis pipelines like PhenoGMM. |
| C_58 | Method | Traditional cytometric fingerprinting approaches for bacterial communities, suchs as manual annotation of clusters or automated binning strategies, have drawbacks including being laborious, operator-dependent, generating many variables, and considering only bivariate interactions. | 22 | PhenoGMM addresses these shortcomings by modeling the full multivariate parameter space at once. |
| C_59 | Method | PhenoGMM models the full parameter space of multivariate flow cytometry data, reducing the number of community-describing variables significantly compared to traditional binning approaches, and can describe data distribution without identifying separated populations. | 22 | This allows for the description of potentially many overlapping cell populations. |
| C_60 | Result | In synthetic microbial communities, PhenoGMM showed moderate to highly correlated alpha-diversity estimations and a better correspondence to predefined community compositions compared to a generic binning approach (PhenoGrid). | 22 | This indicates that PhenoGMM captures community structure rather than identity. |
| C_61 | Result | PhenoGMM successfully quantified the community structure of most natural freshwater microbial communities, and its beta-diversity estimations showed strong correlations, indicating effectiveness in describing intercommunity differences. | 22 | Its ability depended on the ecosystem of study and its specific implementation. |

| C_75 | Method | Random forests provide feature importance measures that can identify key predictive genes in gene expression classification tasks. | 28 | Variable importance measures have been suggested as screening tools for gene expression studies. |
| C_76 | Method | Logistic regression with L1 regularization (lasso) performs automatic feature selection by shrinking coefficients of less important features to zero. | 28 | L1 penalty enables sparse solutions suitable for high-dimensional gene expression data. |
| C_77 | Method | Support vector machines can identify support vectors that define decision boundaries, providing insight into which samples are most informative for classification. | 28 | SVMs are well-suited for high-dimensional problems where the number of features exceeds the number of samples. |
| C_78 | Result | Random forest gene selection yields very small sets of genes while preserving predictive accuracy, often smaller than alternative methods. | 28 | Demonstrated using simulated and nine microarray datasets. |
| C_79 | Method | Elastic net combines L1 (lasso) and L2 (ridge) regularization penalties to perform both variable selection and regularization. | 29 | Particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much larger than the number of observations (n). |
| C_80 | Method | Elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. | 29 | Addresses limitations of lasso in the p >> n case. |
| C_81 | Method | XGBoost is a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system that uses a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. | 30 | Widely used by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on machine learning challenges. |
| C_82 | Method | XGBoost provides insights on cache access patterns, data compression, and sharding to build scalable tree boosting systems. | 30 | Enables efficient handling of large-scale datasets. |
| C_83 | Method | Random forests are a combination of tree predictors where each tree depends on values of a random vector sampled independently with the same distribution for all trees. | 31 | The generalization error converges as the number of trees increases. |
| C_84 | Method | Random forests provide robustness to noise and can handle high-dimensional data where the number of features exceeds the number of samples. | 31 | Ensemble approach aggregates predictions across multiple trees. |
| C_85 | Method | Support vector machines with recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) can perform gene selection for cancer classification from microarray data. | 32 | Genes selected by SVM-RFE yield better classification performance and are biologically relevant to cancer. |
| C_86 | Method | SVMs are particularly effective for high-dimensional gene expression data where the number of features often exceeds the number of samples. | 32 | The kernel trick allows SVMs to capture non-linear relationships. |
| C_87 | Result | Neural networks outperform state-of-the-art methods only for very large training set sizes in gene expression classification. | 33 | For small training sets, transfer learning may strongly improve model performance. |
| C_88 | Method | Deep learning requires sufficient data to achieve superior performance on gene expression classification tasks. | 33 | The n << p property (few samples, many features) has historically prevented effective use of deep learning for gene expression data. |

| C_89 | Method | Frozen RMA (fRMA) allows microarrays to be analyzed individually or in small batches by precomputing probe-specific effects and variances from large public databases. | 40 | Addresses the clinical need to process samples individually without requiring a batch. |
| C_90 | Challenge | RMA cannot be used in clinical settings where samples must be processed individually or in small batches, and datasets preprocessed separately are not comparable. | 40 | This is a fundamental limitation of multiarray methods for clinical deployment. |
| C_91 | Method | Reference-based normalization adjusts a single sample against a pre-computed reference distribution from training data, enabling single-patient molecular testing. | 40, 41 | Critical for clinical deployment where each patient sample may constitute its own "batch." |
| C_92 | Result | fRMA is comparable to RMA when data are analyzed as a single batch and outperforms RMA when analyzing multiple batches. | 40 | Demonstrates that reference-based approaches maintain quality while enabling flexibility. |
| C_93 | Method | Beta values for DNA methylation are bounded between 0 and 1 and approximately follow a beta distribution, violating assumptions of methods designed for unbounded data. | 34 | This necessitates transformation to M-values before applying standard batch correction. |
| C_94 | Method | M-values (log2 ratio of methylated to unmethylated intensities) are approximately normally distributed and unbounded, making them more suitable for standard batch correction methods than beta values. | 34 | The M-value has better statistical properties for differential methylation analysis. |
| C_95 | Result | The M-value is more statistically valid for differential analysis of methylation levels, while the beta-value has more intuitive biological interpretation. | 34 | Recommendation: use M-values for analysis, report beta-values for interpretation. |
| C_96 | Challenge | Mass spectrometry-based proteomics data are inherently biased due to sample handling, instrumentation differences, and other technical factors requiring normalization. | 35 | Batch effects in proteomics manifest as systematic shifts in ionization efficiency and instrument sensitivity. |
| C_97 | Method | Quantile normalization, median normalization, and variance stabilization normalization (VSN) are commonly used for proteomics data, each with different assumptions and performance characteristics. | 35 | The choice of normalization method significantly impacts downstream analysis results. |
| C_98 | Result | No single normalization method performs best across all proteomics datasets; method selection should consider data characteristics and experimental design. | 35 | Systematic evaluation across multiple datasets reveals context-dependent performance. |
| C_99 | Impact | The Precision Medicine Initiative aims to enable prevention and treatment strategies that account for individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle. | 36 | Launched in 2015 to accelerate biomedical discoveries and provide clinicians with new tools. |
| C_100 | Impact | Precision medicine requires integration of large-scale genomic data with clinical information to tailor treatments to individual patients. | 36, 37 | Data integration is fundamental to realizing the promise of precision medicine. |
| C_101 | Phenomenon | Shortcut learning occurs when deep neural networks exploit spurious correlations in training data that perform well on standard benchmarks but fail to transfer to more challenging testing conditions. | 38 | Models learn decision rules based on easy-to-identify features rather than intended causal relationships. |
| C_102 | Phenomenon | In genomic data, shortcut learning can cause models to encode batch identity as a primary latent dimension because batch effects often explain substantial variance. | 38 | This creates models that appear to learn rich representations but actually distinguish technical artifacts. |
| C_103 | Method | Domain-adversarial training uses gradient reversal layers to learn features that are discriminative for the main task but indiscriminate with respect to domain shift. | 39 | Forces the network to learn batch-invariant representations through adversarial training. |
| C_104 | Method | Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) enables domain adaptation by reversing gradients during backpropagation, making the feature extractor unable to discriminate between domains. | 39 | This approach can be implemented with minimal modifications to standard neural network architectures. |
